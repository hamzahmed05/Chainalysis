1. Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?
      **Yes, when using the Blockchain API to retreive the prices, I simply returned the first order set of prices from the object that contains all orders.** 


2. Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)?
  **For the sake of simplicity of an application containing only two service prodivers, it is not over-designed. 
  I wanted to create an application that simply follows the instructions given. For further emphasis on design, user research would be necassary.**  

3. If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
    **For starters, a database would be absolutely necassary along with multiple reliable web servers.
    I would also add a load balancer, which is a software component that helps to spread the traffic across the number of servers, to imporve responsiveness and
    availability of the system.**
    
  
  
4. What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation?
    **other than the stated points mentioned, I would enhance the UX and UI elements**
